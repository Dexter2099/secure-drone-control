# Drone Command & Control System

A real-time drone telemetry and command interface, modeled after military-grade operations for UAV control. Built using modern web technologies and secure communication protocols, this project is designed to simulate tactical drone oversight — ideal for aerospace, defense, or simulation software roles.

---

## Features

- Real-time drone telemetry stream (lat, lon, altitude, speed, battery)
- Live drone marker with auto-recentering on **Leaflet.js** map
- Send tactical commands to the drone: `Return to Base`, `Hold Position`
- Socket.IO over secure or plain WebSocket channel
- Persistent telemetry logging to **SQLite**
- Simple Python drone simulator included
- Built with **Flask**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and run the full stack locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-drone-control.git
cd secure-drone-control

# 2. Backend Setup (Python 3.9+)
cd backend
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate self-signed certificates (development only)
mkdir -p certs
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certs/key.pem \
    -x509 -days 365 -out certs/cert.pem

# Optional: set a token to authorize command events
export COMMAND_TOKEN=mysecret

# 3. Start the Flask server
python app.py

# The `telemetry.db` file used by the server is created
# automatically on first launch when telemetry is stored.

# 4. Run the Drone Simulator (in another terminal)
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python simulator.py

# 5. Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
export VITE_COMMAND_TOKEN=mysecret
npm run dev

# Frontend runs at:
http://localhost:5173
